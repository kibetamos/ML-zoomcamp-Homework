## Flight Delay and Cancellation Prediction

## Project Overview

    Flight delays and cancellations are a common issue in air travel, impacting millions of passengers annually. Delays can lead to missed connections, additional expenses, and significant disruptions for both airlines and travelers. This project aims to leverage historical flight data to predict the likelihood of a flight being delayed or canceled before departure, providing valuable insights for passengers, airlines, and travel planning applications.

    By predicting flight delays and cancellations in advance, airlines and passengers can make better decisions. For instance, passengers might choose flights with a lower risk of delay, or airlines could proactively manage scheduling to minimize the ripple effects of delays across their networks.

## Problem Statement

    The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates the likelihood of a flight delay or cancellation based on factors such as:

        Date and time of departure
        Airline
        Departure and arrival airports
        Historical data on delay reasons
        Other relevant features like weather (if available)

    Using this information, the model will classify flights as likely to be "On-Time," "Delayed," or "Canceled."


## Use Cases

1. For Travelers: With access to delay predictions, travelers can make informed decisions about their flights, potentially opting for flights with lower predicted delay risk.

2. For Airlines: Airlines can use this model to adjust operations and prepare in advance for flights that have a high likelihood of delay, minimizing disruptions to their schedules.

3. For Travel Apps and Platforms: Integrating delay prediction as a feature can improve user experience and engagement, giving passengers an added layer of confidence in planning their trips.

## Data and Methodology
The project uses the Flight Delays and Cancellations dataset from Kaggle, which includes detailed records on flights in the United States, including information on delay reasons and cancellation causes. Using this dataset, we will:

- Perform exploratory data analysis to understand delay patterns and correlations between features.
- Apply feature engineering techniques to prepare the data for modeling, including handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
- Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models, selecting the best-performing model for deployment.
- Deploy the model as an API that accepts flight details and returns delay and cancellation probabilities.

## Deployment and Usage
The predictive model will be deployed as a REST API using a framework like Flask or BentoML. This will allow real-time access to the modelâ€™s predictions through simple API requests. 
The deployment environment will be containerized using Docker, with optional cloud deployment on platforms like AWS or Google Cloud for scalability.
